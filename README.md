# SPSRC Jupyter/Binder Hubs deployments at the SPSRC

The SPSRC JupyterHub/BinderHub Services Repository is a centralized collection of `YAML` files and Notebook services deployed at the SPSRC. This repository aims to gather and showcase a variety of JupyterHub services that have been implemented and customized to meet the specific needs of different projects, schools and workflows at the SPSRC. 

By sharing these services, we aim to promote collaboration, knowledge sharing, and the reusability of JupyterHub configurations within our organization. The repository serves as a valuable resource for SPSRC members to discover, contribute, and learn from the diverse range of JupyterHub services that have been successfully deployed within our environment.
